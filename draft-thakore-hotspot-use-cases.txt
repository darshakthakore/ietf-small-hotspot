1.  Introduction

   Provide an introduction to hotspot and explain the infra needed to
   deploy a hs system.

1.1.  The Need for simpler mechanism

   Why and where will this use case help (mom and pop shops).  What's
   better with this compared to status quo

2.  Basic Protocol Operation

   What's the initial architecture proposal if any.  Start with
   reference to captive portal api and how we can leverage it for small
   hs use case
